# Component Configuration Reference

Components are reusable service definitions that perform specific tasks within workflows. They encapsulate functionality such as HTTP requests, AI model inference, data processing, and external service integration.

## Basic Structure

### Single Component

```yaml
component:
  type: agent | http-client | http-server | mcp-server | mcp-client | model | model-memory | model-tokenizer | model-trainer | datasets | vector-store | graph-store | search-engine | key-value-store | file-store | workflow | shell | text-splitter | image-processor | video-scene-detector | video-frame-extractor | web-scraper | web-browser
  id: component-id
  runtime: embedded | docker  # default: embedded
  max_concurrent_count: 1
  default: false
  # ... type-specific configuration
```

### Multiple Components

```yaml
components:
  - id: api-client
    type: http-client
    base_url: https://api.example.com
    
  - id: local-model
    type: model
    model: microsoft/DialoGPT-medium
    
  - id: data-processor
    type: shell
    command: python process.py
```

## Common Configuration Properties

All components inherit these common properties from `CommonComponentConfig`:

### Core Properties

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `id` | string | `__default__` | Unique identifier for the component |
| `type` | string | **required** | Component type (see table above) |
| `runtime` | string | `embedded` | Runtime environment: `embedded`, `process`, or `docker` |
| `max_concurrent_count` | integer | `1` | Maximum concurrent actions this component can handle |
| `default` | boolean | `false` | Whether to use this component when none is explicitly specified |

### Actions

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `action` | object | - | Single action definition for the component (shorthand for single-action components) |
| `actions` | array | `[]` | List of actions available within this component (for multi-action components) |

Components can define a single action using `action:` (singular) or multiple actions using `actions:` (plural). This is consistent with the `component:` / `components:` pattern used elsewhere.

## Component Usage Patterns

### Single Action Component

For simple components with one primary action, wrap the action-specific fields under `action:`:

```yaml
component:
  type: http-client
  base_url: https://api.openai.com/v1
  action:
    path: /chat/completions
    method: POST
    headers:
      Authorization: Bearer ${env.OPENAI_API_KEY}
    body:
      model: gpt-4o
      messages:
        - role: user
          content: ${input.prompt}
```

### Multi-Action Component

For components supporting multiple operations:

```yaml
component:
  type: http-client
  base_url: https://api.slack.com
  actions:
    - id: send-message
      path: /chat.postMessage
      method: POST
      body:
        channel: ${input.channel}
        text: ${input.text}
        
    - id: list-channels
      path: /conversations.list
      method: GET
      params:
        limit: 200
```

### Default Component

Mark a component as default to use it when no specific component is referenced:

```yaml
components:
  - id: primary-model
    type: model
    model: gpt-4o
    default: true
    
  - id: backup-model
    type: model
    model: gpt-3.5-turbo
```

## Runtime Configuration

Components can run in different runtime environments. The runtime determines where and how the component executes.

### Embedded Runtime (Default)

The default runtime that executes components in the current process.

```yaml
component:
  type: model
  runtime: embedded  # or omit this line (embedded is default)
  model: microsoft/DialoGPT-medium
```

**Characteristics:**
- Runs in the same process as the controller
- Fastest startup time and lowest overhead
- Shares memory space with the main application
- Best for lightweight tasks and quick operations

**Use Cases:**
- Simple API calls and HTTP requests
- Lightweight data transformations
- Quick model inference with small models
- Components that need fast response times

### Process Runtime

Runs components in separate Python processes for process isolation while maintaining faster startup than Docker.

```yaml
component:
  type: model
  runtime: process
  model: meta-llama/Llama-3.1-70B
```

**Characteristics:**
- Runs in a separate Python process
- Process-level memory and resource isolation
- Faster startup than Docker, slower than embedded
- Independent crash handling (one component crash won't affect others)

**Use Cases:**
- Heavy models that could consume significant memory
- Multiple GPU utilization (separate processes for each GPU)
- Blocking operations that shouldn't block the main event loop
- Components that need isolation but don't require containers

**Advanced Configuration:**

```yaml
component:
  type: model
  runtime:
    type: process
    env:
      CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES: "0"
      PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF: "max_split_size_mb:512"
    start_timeout: 120
    stop_timeout: 30
  model: stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0
```

### Docker Runtime

Runs components in isolated Docker containers for enhanced security and reproducibility.

```yaml
component:
  type: model
  runtime: docker
  model: meta-llama/Llama-3.1-70B
```

**Characteristics:**
- Complete process and resource isolation
- Reproducible environment across deployments
- Better security through containerization
- Higher startup overhead

**Use Cases:**
- Production deployments requiring isolation
- Large models that need resource limits
- Components with specific dependency requirements
- Multi-tenant scenarios requiring security

### Choosing a Runtime

| Runtime | Startup Speed | Isolation | Overhead | Best For |
|---------|--------------|-----------|----------|----------|
| **embedded** | Fast | None | Minimal | Default choice, lightweight tasks |
| **process** | Medium | Process | Medium | Heavy models, GPU isolation, crash isolation |
| **docker** | Slow | High | High | Production, security-critical workloads |

## Concurrency Control

Control how many actions can run simultaneously:

```yaml
component:
  type: http-client
  max_concurrent_count: 5
  base_url: https://api.example.com
```

This allows up to 5 concurrent HTTP requests from this component.

## Component Lifecycle

Components follow this lifecycle:

1. **Initialization**: Component is created and configured
2. **Setup**: Runtime environment is prepared (Docker images pulled, dependencies installed)
3. **Ready**: Component is available to handle actions
4. **Execution**: Actions are processed according to workflow requirements
5. **Shutdown**: Component resources are cleaned up

## Integration with Workflows

Components are referenced in workflows through jobs:

```yaml
workflow:
  jobs:
    - id: api-call
      component: http-client-id
      action: post-data
      input:
        data: ${input.payload}
        
    - id: process-result
      component: shell-processor
      input:
        result: ${api-call.output}
```

## Variable Interpolation

Components support dynamic configuration through variable interpolation:

- **Environment Variables**: `${env.API_KEY}`
- **Input Data**: `${input.field}`
- **Previous Results**: `${previous-job.output}`
- **Type Conversion**: `${input.count as number}`
- **Default Values**: `${input.optional | default-value}`

## Error Handling

Components can be configured with error handling strategies:

```yaml
component:
  type: http-client
  retry_count: 3
  timeout: 30
  base_url: https://api.example.com
```

## Security Considerations

- **Credentials**: Store sensitive data in environment variables
- **Network**: Use HTTPS endpoints when possible
- **Isolation**: Consider Docker runtime for untrusted code execution
- **Access Control**: Limit file system access and network permissions

## Best Practices

1. **Naming**: Use descriptive component IDs that indicate their purpose
2. **Modularity**: Design components for specific, well-defined tasks
3. **Reusability**: Create generic components that can be used across workflows
4. **Configuration**: Use environment variables for deployment-specific settings
5. **Documentation**: Document custom actions and expected inputs/outputs
6. **Error Handling**: Implement appropriate retry and timeout strategies
7. **Resource Management**: Set appropriate concurrency limits for resource-intensive operations
